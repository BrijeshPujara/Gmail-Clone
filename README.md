# Gmail-Clone
Gmail react clone, working with Redux, Material UI. The application also has google authentication and is hosted with firebase.

## Lessons Learned 
Consistent use of react hooks and the use of react-hook-forms v7. Migrating from v6 to v7 and making use of the docs to integrate correctly.
